Changelog and Versions 

* Version 1.4 (in development)
* Version 1.3.1
** Fixes to OfflineMonitor CMake configuration and compilation on WIN32/MSVC
** Fixes to EUDAQ version parsing during CMake configuration step
** Fixes (optional) linking of main library to ROOT libraries
** Fixes compilation issues on WIN32 with Visual Studio 2012

* Version 1.3
** New user-provided producers/converters:
   - miniTLU (Francesco Crescioli/David Cussans)
   - MuPix converter (Moritz Kiehn)
** Changes to existing Producers/converters:
   - updated APIX FEI4 converter
   - updated all converter plugins to work with the new EUTelescope pixel structures
   - modified producers to use fixed-width integers where made
     necessary due to core library changes
** New Tools
*** FileChecker (by Moritz Kiehn)
    a small utility to check raw data files (see manual for a description)
*** OfflineMonitor (by Richard Peschke)
** Python Interface
   - provides Python instances of RunControl, DataCollector,
     LogCollector and a generic Producer
   - allows for Python-side extensions to Producer
   - provides interface for scripted data taking sessions
** Multiple (named) DataCollectors
   - it is now possible to start up several DataCollectors
   - named DataCollectors will be assigned to a Producer with the same
     name allowing for locally running data sinks
** Regression tests
   - includes first tests for core EUDAQ components based on Python wrapper
   - starts a (dummy) DAQ session and verifies the output against a reference file
   - tests run via CTest
   - scripts for automated nightly tests provided
** Notes on updating
*** EUDAQ now requires a compiler which fully implements C++11
    - GCC version > 4.6
    - Clang version > 3.1
    - MSVC12 or later
*** counted_ptr class removed (superseded by C++11-featured shared_ptr)
*** EUDAQThreads class removed (superseded by C++11 std::threads)
*** core library now uses fixed-width integers consistently -- this might require changes to existing producers
*** FileReader interface changed: only takes two arguments now, omitting the "synctrigger" flag 
* Version 1.2.2
** Updated EUTelescope-dependent parts to work with newest development version
* Version 1.2.1
** Fixed compilation issue of NativeReader Marlin library
   - removed obsolete converter plugin relying no longer existing EUTelescope headers
** Updated APIX-CT-ConverterPlugin (provided by Stefano Terzo)
* Version 1.2.0
** CMake build system
   - Multiplatform build system
   - out-of-source builds
   - Builds with gcc on Linux (e.g. 4.7 on Ubuntu 12.04), Clang on OSX (e.g. 4.2 on OSX 10.8), and MSVC on Windows (MSVC 12 on Windows 7, 32bit)
   - recommend CMake 2.8.12, but should work even with CMake 2.6
   - see updated install instructions in README or the manual
** Restructuring of directory hierarchy
   - all producers are stored in separate directory
   - central library is located separately from executables and by default installed in ./lib
** Cleanup of repository
   (almost) no binary files are now distributed with the code:
   - no windows drivers (pthreads, libusb)
   - no Mimosa26 DAQ labview projects
   - no MS Visual Studio files or precompiled W32 binaries
   - manual is no longer provided as pdf but only in source (and can be downloaded from the homepage)
   - no ZestSC1 driver files (need to be downloaded from AFS, see instructions for installation in README.md)
** Updated and extended documentation
   - user manual
   - web pages (http://eudaq.github.io/)
   - source code using doxygen ("make doxygen")
** New user-provided producers:
   - Explorer-1 (Felix Reidt)
** NativeReader Marlin library for LCIO conversion
   - used to interface with EUTelescope analysis framework for data conversion from RAW into LCIO format
** Changes to existing Producers:
*** TLU
* Version 1.1 
** New features and change log
*** General
    - EUDAQ main components compile and run under Windows 7 now (VS 2012), executables are included
    - improved stability
    - data collector can now run on different PC from run control
    - added Mimosa32 producer (by Ilaria Aimo)
    - there are now two FEI4B converter plugins (USBPIX/RCE), see notes on updating
    - updated TimepixConverterPlugin (by Mathieu Benoit)
    - now hosted on github
*** 1.1.0 (15.08.2013)
    - improved stability: better exception handling of run control when log collector fails
    - improved stability: run control GUI application properly catches exceptions
    - reduced verbosity of online monitor
    - added some debugging facilities for low-level methods in TransportTCP.cc
    - NI producer: NI PCs address does not need to be in system's host file any more
    - data and logs folders are now present already in the repository; can be replaced e.g. with symlink by the user
    - fixed compilation on gcc 4.7
    - fixed build warnings
** Notes on updating
*** USBPIX/RCE systems
    breaking backward compatibility with data taken with RCE system of
    FEI4B modules (tagged USBPIXI4B before today or with eudaq
    v01-00-00) from now on, there are 2 FEI4B converter plugins for
    USBPIX system (USBpixI4BConverterPlugin) and for RCE system
    (RCEI4ConverterPlugin)
** Known Issues
   For up-to-date details, check https://github.com/eudaq/eudaq/issues
*** issue #1: Instabilities during data-taking
    - some improvements since version 1.0 but no long term experience yet
*** issue #2: Online monitor does not yet work on Windows

* Version 1.0
** New features and change log
*** General
    - first 'release': snapshot of development until April 2013
    - EUDAQ developed since 2007 and in successful operation with various devices for years!
*** 1.0.3
    - change of default control voltage for PMTs, now it's 800 mV
*** 1.0.2
    - changes in USBpixI4BConverterPlugin and RCEI4BConverterPlugin
*** 1.0.1
    - changes to FEI4B converter plugin.
*** 1.0.0

** Known issues
   For up-to-date details, check https://github.com/eudaq/eudaq/issues
*** Instabilities during data-taking
    - euRun crashes, sometimes with uncaught exceptions, sometimes with segfaults
    - crashes occur 'regularly', on some systems every hour or others a couple of times per day
